# Using Linaro DDT on Alpine to Debug Parallel Code (an RC Primer)
 
Linaro DDT is an advanced, licensed debugger designed to simplify the troubleshooting and optimization of complex, high-performance computing (HPC) applications. It is particularly well-suited for compiled codes (c/c++/fortran) and can be applied to both CPUs and GPUs. This one-hour primer will provide an overview of DDT with a focus on its features for supporting multi-threaded processes, including memory debugging and visualizations. Users with CURC accounts will have the option of following along with practical debugging exercises on the Alpine supercomputer.
 
Prerequisites: A basic knowledge of high performance computing and at least one compiled language (c/c++/fortran). Participants planning to follow along with DDT exercises should have a research computing account. This primer is best suited for participants with intermediate to advanced high-performance computing knowledge.
 
*What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
